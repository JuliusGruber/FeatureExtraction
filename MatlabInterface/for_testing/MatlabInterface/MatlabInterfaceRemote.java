/**
 * The <code>MatlabInterfaceRemote</code> class provides a Java RMI-compliant interface 
 * to the M-functions from the files:
 * <pre>
 *  C:\\Users\\Julius Gruber\\Dropbox\\Master\\matlab\\functions\\feAndDimensionReduction.m
 *  C:\\Users\\Julius Gruber\\Dropbox\\Master\\matlab\\functions\\feAndDimensionReduction1.m
 *  C:\\Users\\Julius Gruber\\Dropbox\\Master\\matlab\\functions\\feAndDimensionReduction2.m
 *  C:\\Users\\Julius Gruber\\Dropbox\\Master\\matlab\\functions\\feAndDimensionReduction3.m
 *  C:\\Users\\Julius Gruber\\Dropbox\\Master\\matlab\\functions\\getAllFileNames.m
 * </pre>
 * The {@link #dispose} method <b>must</b> be called on a 
 * <code>MatlabInterfaceRemote</code> instance when it is no longer needed to ensure that 
 * native resources allocated by this class are properly freed, and the server-side proxy 
 * is unexported.  (Failure to call dispose may result in server-side threads not being 
 * properly shut down, which often appears as a hang.)  
 *
 * This interface is designed to be used together with 
 * <code>com.mathworks.toolbox.javabuilder.remoting.RemoteProxy</code> to automatically 
 * generate RMI server proxy objects for instances of MatlabInterface.MatlabInterface.
